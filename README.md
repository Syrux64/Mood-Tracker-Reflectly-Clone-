# Mood Tracker
- This Mood tracking application allows the user to keep track of the mood 
they are currently in. It prompts them with the required questions, such as 
causes and reasons, and saves the data locally so that the details are later 
retrieved.
- This application also contains daily challenges to help the user stay 
productive. 
- Concepts such as Data Structure and File Handling are used together with 
JavaFX to program this application.
